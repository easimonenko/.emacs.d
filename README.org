#+TITLE: .emacs.d using only builtins

Simple configuration for GNU Emacs for programming, writing and other stuff using only builtins. It is useful when there is no Internet access, you just need to edit the file or as a basis for creating an extended configuration. It works with Emacs version 29.1 or later.

Before using it, copy the =custom-template.el= to =custom.el=. And then, in the command prompt, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
emacs --init-directory=.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

You can also move =.emacs.d= to =~/.emacs.d= and then use this configuration as the main configuration by simply launching:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
emacs
#+END_SRC
